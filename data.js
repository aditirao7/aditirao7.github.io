    "I'm a Computer Science graduate from Manipal Institute of Technology. My academic journey was enriched by a minor in Big Data Analytics, which deepened my understanding of Artificial Intelligence and data-driven solutions.",
    "The most exhilarating part of my college experience was my involvement with the Mars Rover Manipal team during my initial two years. It was a transformative experience where I contributed to the development of autonomous algorithms for various robotic systems. My responsibilities included creating algorithms for obstacle avoidance, navigation search strategies, and object detection. This hands-on experience instilled problem-solving skills and honed my technical prowess. I kicked off my professional career with a dynamic startup called FastHr.ai and later embarked on a comprehensive six-month internship at Amazon. These experiences further expanded my skill set and provided insights into the corporate landscape.",
    "Currently, I'm immersed in the realm of freelancing, working on a variety of projects that continually challenge and inspire me. While I enjoy the flexibility of freelancing, I remain open to exploring full-time opportunities in software development. If you have a project that aligns with my skill set, let's connect!",
    "Beyond my professional endeavors, I enjoy swimming and playing badminton. I also really enjoy watching cricket with my dad. I'm an avid reader and one may often find me curled up in a corner immersed in a book. Another significant part of my life is music, having devoted a decade to training in Hindustani Classical Music.",
    "As a woman in tech, I'm committed to breaking the glass ceiling in this male-dominated field. I aim to use this website as a platform to document my journey as I navigate the ever-evolving landscape of technology. But this website isn't just about tech; it's a canvas for my thoughts and experiences. You may find random memory dumps and musings on my blog soon.",
